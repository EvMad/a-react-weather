## ABOUT

Creating a weather App using React, utilizing Hooks ( { useEffect, useState }) to manage state and handle the rendering and loading of the app. This is my first time using Semantic UI for some predefined components, namely the refresh button and the loading wheel.  I used my OpenWeather API key to make the API calls, and Moment.js for displaying the date and time.
